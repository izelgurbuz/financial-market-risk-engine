1. Why rising rates lower bond prices:
A bond’s coupon is fixed. When new bonds offer higher coupons (e.g. 5% instead of 4%), older bonds must trade at a discount to offer an equivalent yield to buyers. Thus, bond prices fall when market rates rise.

2. Duration:
Duration measures the average time (in present-value terms) it takes to receive the bond’s cash flows.
It’s also a measure of price sensitivity: if duration = 5, a 1% rise in yield causes approximately a 5% drop in price.
Mathematically, it’s the PV-weighted time of all cash flows divided by the total bond price.

3. DV01:
DV01 (Dollar Value of 1 Basis Point) is the change in price for a 0.01% yield change.
It converts duration’s percentage sensitivity into a cash risk amount, showing how much the bond value changes in currency terms.

4. Scenario Analysis & Rate Shocks:
Scenario analysis evaluates how the portfolio reacts to specific market changes (e.g. +2% or –1% rate moves).
Each “rate shock” is a scenario.
Running several shocks (mild/moderate/severe) provides insight into potential future losses under different environments.
